# TimeVia

**Workflow automation for People Operations — omnichannel, policy-driven, AI-native.**

---

## What We're Building

TimeVia eliminates the HR portal. Employees manage time off, leaves, and requests through the tools they already use — Slack, Teams, Google Chat, Discord.

**Not another HR database. A workflow execution layer.**

---

## The Problem

HR tools require adoption. You buy BambooHR, half the company never logs in. Managers forget to approve requests. HR chases people.

Every company's policies are different, but tools force you into rigid defaults or charge enterprise pricing for customization.

---

## Our Approach

**Three layers:**

- **Omnichannel Runtime** — Employees interact through Slack, Teams, email. No portal required.
- **Policy Engine** — Admins define custom rules (eligibility, approvals, restrictions) through a visual builder.
- **AI Agent** — Natural language queries over workforce data. "Who's out next week?" "Show me negative balances."

## Starting With

**PTO & Leave Management**.

Connect Google Workspace or Slack → import employees → configure policies → employees request PTO from Slack on day one.

Expanding into scheduling, custom approval workflows, compliance reporting, and onboarding flows.

---

## Why TimeVia?

We sit in the gap between lightweight PTO trackers and heavyweight HRIS platforms.
